ORANGE
Shape policy: approach media and authorities
Collaboration on mobility processes
Policy: regular public posts and use-cases to spread awareness
Recommend and support “Best Practices” or standards
Long-term goals: become well-established and functional community; a data and analytics hub to find relevant information and tools from one place
Strongly encourage participation from underrepresented or marginalized groups
Continuous collaboration between each stakeholder for sustainable mobility improvement/development (e.g., government, transport operators, university)
Identify gaps in knowledge & understanding; could be done by network mapping related research
Establish/step mobility studies as a field so researchers stop saying “I don’t know what I am”
Collaborative urban living labs?
Develop data collection and processing methods and be in contact with policymakers to meet their expectations
Provide info for general public
Open code + tools
Engage/work with policymakers & public/local communities in our research
Facilitating collaboration and distributing knowledge/data
Including cities, policymakers, and businesses
Open toolkit for analyzing mobility data
One thing that could make a group stand out is actually focusing on stakeholder engagement outside purely academia

GREEN
DATA COLLECTIVE: open, sharing tools, search of data/metadata, inclusive (OSS/resources), common project applications
If there is a fee, no membership fee for global south students
Hosting steering committee from various demographic, career stage, industry/academic/policy
Intermediary role for making connections between academics, industry, and decision-makers
Anyone can access data and analytics globally (compliant)
Clear and transparent communication between scientists and policymakers to ensure the creation of actionable solutions
A framework that allows collecting, possibly standardizing, and retrieving information from science-policy mechanisms
A distributed method for hosting and processing data that is compatible with different countries’ regulations
Standardized collected data to be appealing to different stakeholders
Capitalize on existing initiatives (e.g., Data for Policy, Urban Labs, Services like NECTAR)
Ensure outputs are documented, explained, and easily findable so others can reuse them
Regular coaching to explain what "responsible research" means in specific cultural/national contexts
Apply for funding once knowledge has been tested; don’t try to start it off immediately
Public institutions and NGOs must guide and lead the project
Important source providers include data-sharing developers, platforms, models, and data collectors
Academic institutions should provide resources and develop methodology
Use understandable formats: metadata, coding, open standards
Ethical agreements should include privacy protocols
Make physicists, CS people, engineers, geographers, etc., work together and learn other disciplines
Ensure accessibility for people with limited experience or from less prestigious institutions
Create more opportunities for students through interdisciplinary degree programs
Have a small number of "leading" roles with shared responsibilities otherwise
Develop datasets/models/methods and make results open, reproducible, and transferable
Mix junior and senior researchers to foster guidance and curiosity
Roles and commitments include data sharing, participation, and meetings
Provide good documentation of data/tools so collaborators know how to use them (e.g., platform, purpose, interaction, licensing)
If you use anything, your new insights have to be shared on the platform
Outline advantages for every participant
Voting members need to be contributors (e.g., data, funding, tools, infrastructure)
Start as a loose group of interested volunteers involved in mobility
Data-sharing is the strength; even sharing contact info is useful if data isn’t ready
Ensuring equitable participation requires raising awareness across disciplines and continents
The collective should make datasets, tools, and insights visible on the website
EQUITABLE PARTICIPATION: FOSS platforms, spirit of togetherness, semantic tools, common terminology, possibilities for all
Mentorship should be central, with student involvement in all aspects and travel support for conferences
“Open” should be a requirement for data, tools, and publications
Use a federated structure
Provide a usable API
Include stakeholders such as researchers (univs, NGOs), developers, and low-skilled participants
Provide a guide for data collection, data ethics, and data usage
Ensure diversity: individuals with different strengths in data accessibility and collection, collaboration with government and ministries
Promote cross collaboration through multidisciplinary groups, workshops, shared curriculum design, and thesis co-supervision
Ensure equity in funding, background, participation, collaboration, and evaluation/feedback
Consider compatibility of mobility-based research questions vs. real-world scenarios
PLATFORM: automatic trajectory data collecting APIs
Showcase open-sourced data-sharing platforms (e.g., OGC)
Enable volunteer-led contributions like question boards and prompts with target keywords (e.g., trained models)
Include international participants from governments, international orgs, and private sectors


PURPLE
Communication: good website is key, GitHub organization for the collective, mailing list would be nice
Events: bi-annual conference? working group meetings twice a year
Online seminars/lectures
Hackathons or challenge competitions that join up private stakeholders and funding that actually gets used—some useful for local governments
A conference would be great; a website with output, ideas, research, achievements; brainstorming through emails or video calls for writing a paper
Events: lightning talks, discovery workshops
Communication: regular chat times to calendar (idea)
Monthly meetings or lightning talks (spots available to reserve)
Wondering: responsibility (rotation?) for mailing list, workshops, online meetings, etc.
Social platforms and e-newsletters written by students, researchers, or any interested person internal to the domain
Delegate/employ a social media manager
Workshops at different conferences
Online "Research Roundups"
Incentivize participation by organizing competitions or prizes
Website listing projects and members, blogs/posts highlighting research from different teams
Capitalize on existing platforms like Slack or elements of sharepoints or GitHub
Use funding that expects knowledge exchange as deliverables, like WIDERA or Erasmus style
Co-organize MOOCs
Student mobility between research groups/members
Need to have accountability: president or leader, take turns every year
Hackathons, mapathons, datathons, online regular lightning talks and a conference once a year (perhaps existing?)
Having other versions of this workshop: a series of seminars (e.g., bi-monthly), online presentation of research
Yearly workshop
I really liked this workshop better than a conference, etc.
Regular meetings/workshops among different stakeholders about mobility data, sharing and analytics
Events that have a strong and social component can foster some sense of identity and culture as a network; don’t make it too content-focused
Future events/workshops including all stakeholders; express interest, especially contribute to the laboratory together; sharing platform/websites
Hackathons: shared repositories, periodic meetings (rotating volunteers?)
Workshops/symposium with annual conferences, student/ECR paper competition, successful case study sharing


YELLOW
Sharing mobility data openly is challenging due to business interests of the companies; sharing among members of the collective would be easier
App-based mobility data is good for allowing similar data collection across countries (e.g., SafeGraph); tools: movingpandas, GTFS, SSP, R5, scikit-mobility
U.S. Census API is surprisingly easy and useful; we should learn from them
A lot of datasets are good but have bad documentation/labels
Each country has their own legislation related to sharing mobility data, which is a challenge for creating comparable data across countries
Legal force on tech companies to share their datasets (e.g., data from Google, Uber, Apple)
I recommend municipalities making use of data as part of evaluation and planning
A platform to summarize/list all the available mobility data (e.g., from GPS)
Data: OD flows, routes, APIs, networks, mobility model
Mobility data brings money, people, academic reputation—why would they want it open?
SUMO simulation models
San Francisco taxi dataset
Sharing mobility data openly is challenging due to business interests—internal sharing easier
Datasets and tools: app-based mobility data, tools like movingpandas, GTFS, SSP, scikit-mobility
U.S. Census API is surprisingly easy and useful; we should learn from it
Privacy issues
A lot of datasets are good but have bad documentation or labels
Barriers: each country has its own legislation related to sharing mobility data, making it hard to create comparable datasets across countries
Legal force on tech companies to share data
I recommend municipalities make data use part of evaluation and planning
A platform is needed to summarize/list all usable mobility data (e.g., GPS-based)
Data types: OD flows, routes, APIs, networks, mobility models
Mobility data brings money, reputation, and academic capital—why make it open?
Capability, opportunity, behavior, and motivation: data should include all aspects to support sustainability analysis
Synthetic data can be built from existing mobility datasets
Barriers: privacy—data must be stored anonymized
GAPS: spatio-temporal formats
Any participatory tool for storing data must be super simple to use and anonymous; don’t store users’ data (e.g., transparency.csv)
Difficulty of data sharing when there are competing mobility-related companies (e.g., different transport operators)
Data is pretty valuable and so expensive
Ethical/legal: sharing data should consider privacy protocols, especially in different contexts
Gaps & Barriers: data accessibility and quality, data privacy/ownership, data bias/representativeness, data consistency in space and time, data licenses
Stakeholders can get costly local cluster data to maintain, but unless infrastructure is good, the value is limited; who are these people with idle servers?
Standardized origin-destination matrix format: UK uses square grid but Helsinki uses travel zones (TAZ); what defines a neighborhood or region?
Main challenge is commercial interest in maintaining proprietary tools, while FOSS and open data try to move forward—an inherent conflict or solvable?
FOSS cities post (e.g., replicability) has great tools but interoperability is still unclear
Cluster-based computing for mobility: edge-based or cloud-based—what’s scalable and P2P compatible?
Gaps & Barriers: data accessibility and quality, data privacy/ownership, data bias, data consistency over time, licenses
Google Maps API, Mapbox API, OpenStreetMap dataset
Existing data tools, etc.: geoprivacy, collaborative GIS, digital twins, data spaces
Open privacy/masking tools (e.g., masking.xyz)
Federated learning or analytics as a solution to data-sharing issues; protect publication use of possible geographies
QSM government datasets: authenticity of the data and standardization
Difficulty of data sharing with competing mobility-related companies
Collection (big effort)
The dataset should include attitudes and habits of people + land use data
Mobility Data Specification (MDS): good starting point—encourage members to use this?
New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission data
Paperwork marginalizing certain demographic groups
Privacy concerns
